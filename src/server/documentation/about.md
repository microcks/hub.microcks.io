Hub.Microcks.io allows **developers**, **standardisation organisations**, **regulatory committees** and **product managers** to **easily distribute their API specifications, mocks and test suites**. 

## Who can benefit from Hub.microcks.io?

[Microcks](https://microcks.io) users can directly access Hub.Microcks.io to retrieve these API artifacts and make them actionable through a number of use-cases:
